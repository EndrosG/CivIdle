TODO:

United Nations Rework:
- General Assembly votes now are guaranteed to have one building from each age.
- General Assembly now only boosts Production Multiplier and the multiplier is now dynamic (i.e. does not affect storage)
- United Nations can now be upgraded, each level provides +1 to General Assembly multipliers


Level Boost Great People:

- William Shepherd: +1 Level to International Space Station
- Lee Kuan Yew: +1 Level to Marina Bay Sands
- Emmanuelle Charpentier: +1 Level to Palm Jumeirah
- Dan Alderson: +1 Level to Alderson Disk
- Freeman Dyson: +1 Level to Dyson Sphere
- Vera Rubin: +1 Level to Matrioshka Brain

They are not required to upgrade Age Wisdom, and Age Wisdom does not affect them. Zenobia (Classical Age) is now a Level Boost Great People as well, which means Classical Age Wisdom will no longer affect Zenobia - the shards you've spent on the upgrade will be refunded

Indian:

- Red Fort: +5 Building Level Boost to all buildings within 4-tile range. This wonder can be upgraded and each additional level provides an extra +1 Building Level Boost

- Sundarbans: Double the effect of all Age Wisdoms
- Sanchi Stupa: Transports from or to buildings within 2-tile range are immediate
- Qutb Minar: When completed, a great person is born - it can come from any age except the current one. This wonder can be upgraded, and each additional upgrade causes another great person to be born, which can come from any age except the current one. When choosing great people from this wonder, 4 choices are provided
- Festival: Diwali: Increase the range of Ganges River to 3-tile. Increase the range of Sanchi Stupa to 3-tile. Double the level boost from Red Fort
- Rabindranath Tagore: +2 Production Multiplier, Storage Multiplier for Embassy

Warp Speed Backport:
Now when running at a higher warp speed, only the extra speed will cost warp.
e.g.:
- At 2x speed, it will cost 1/2 warp per game second (1 warp per wall clock second, previously 2 warp per wall clock second)
- At 3x speed, it will cost 2/3 warp per game second (2 warp per wall clock second, previously 3 warp per wall clock second)
- At 4x speed, it will cost 3/4 warp per game second (3 warp per wall clock second, previously 4 warp per wall clock second)
